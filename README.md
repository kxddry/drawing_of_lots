Бот Телеграм для проведения честных голосований

### The idea:

whenever you have to have a group of people organized in something, something always fails...
for example, whenever you have to agree on an exam time for students, some people will believe
the random online poll is a great option, others will disagree, stating that the best way to choose
whoever gets right of say in the time of the exam is the one who enters the university doors first.
Both of these options suck, and so I've come up with this bot.

The bot allows a group of people to let luck choose the order that people choose in. It uses truly random shuffling.
(In case the random.org API key is wrong or something else goes wrong, pseudo random shuffling).
The people voting don't have to do anything other than press a couple buttons, and that's the best thing about it.
Besides that, though, is the fact that everyone has an equal amount in the right of say. You don't need to have a
faster internet connection or a faster car. Everyone is equal.

Moreover, this system is impeccable and impermeable: it tracks down whenever someone cancels a vote or votes, tells that
to everyone, and if someone has cheated (voted outside their position in line), stops the poll and tells everyone
whoever cheated and how.

With that being said, let the polls start.
